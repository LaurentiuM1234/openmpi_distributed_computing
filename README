============================= DESCRIPTION ================================
(*) this project was realized with the following goals in mind:
	- familiarize myself with OpenMPI
	- better understand how distributed computing works
	- understand and apply different distributed algorithm in order to

(*) the topology of the distributed system was given to us by the TA team
and it consisted of two types of nodes: the coordinator nodes and the
worker nodes. The purpose of the coordinator nodes is to communicate with
each other in order to distribute the work to be done and establish the
topology (since it can change because of a link failing). The purpose of
the worker nodes is to process the work received from their coordinator.

(*) each coordinator node can only communicate with the other coordinator
nodes and with the worker nodes assigned to it; no coordinator is allowed
to directly communicate with the worker nodes assigned to other
coordinator.

============================= WORKFLOW ===================================
(*) COORDINATOR NODES
	(**) STEPS:
		1) Compute the spanning tree

		2) Compute the topology

		3) Distribute the array to be processed among the
		coordinators using the spanning tree

		4) Distribute the array to be processed among the workers
		assigned to current coordinator

		5) Receive the results from the workers

		6) Assemble the array to be processed

		7) (node 0) Print the result

(*) WORKER NODES
	(**) STEPS:
		1) Receive the topology from the assigned coordinator

		2) Print the topology

		3) Receive from the coordinator the piece of array to be
		processed

		4) Send to the coordinator the piece of array that has
		been processed
